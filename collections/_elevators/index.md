For accessibility reasons, passenger elevators may not be blocked or used to transport equipment or freight. Palmer Events Center does provide a back of house freight elevator. The lobby areas and passenger elevators are not to be used for move-in or move-out purposes. Ask your Event Coordinator if you have any questions about elevator capacity.
