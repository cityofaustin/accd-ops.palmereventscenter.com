Alcoholic beverages are not allowed into the facility by any client or outside service. ACCD Catering is our exclusive in-house food and beverage management company. A representative may be reached at (512) 404-4100.

The sales and service of all alcohol in the facility is regulated by the Texas Alcoholic and Beverage Commission (TABC). It is our responsibility to abide by and administer such rules. All alcoholic beverages must be dispensed by TABC trained facility personnel only. Pursuant to Texas State law, it is illegal to serve alcoholic beverages to a minor less than twenty-one (21) years of age. Legal and valid identification will be requested of any individual who appears to be thirty (30) years of age or younger.

We have the right to refuse service to any patron for any reason. Keep in mind that alcohol may not be taken out of the facility.
