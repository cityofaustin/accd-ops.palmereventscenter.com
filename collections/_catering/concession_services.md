Concessions, alcoholic beverages, and catering services are exclusive to ACCD Catering, our in-house food and beverage management company. Arrangements for catering services must be made through your assigned Catering Manager. Contact a food and beverage representative at 512-404- 4100.
							
We have the right to open and maintain concession stands for any event at the facility.

**Things to know:**

- Concessions require a thirty by thirty foot (30’ x 30’) area to service five hundred (500) attendees if no other food options are available; a thirty by sixty foot (30’x 60’) area is required to service one thousand plus (1000+) attendees. This space is for the equipment only; additional space is needed for seating.
- We reserve a minimum of thirty foot by thirty foot (30’x30’) per exhibit hall should concessions, bars or space for food and beverage prep be requested.  Additional space may be required. If concessions or food and beverage are not requested by clients, this space may not be necessary or required.
- Portable concession stands require access to four (4) floor pockets for power requirements or may require a location near a 208 volt power source.
