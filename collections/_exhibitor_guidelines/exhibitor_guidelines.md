Austin Convention Center does not provide exhibit booth cleaning services, equipment, or furniture (pipe, drape, tables, chairs, carpet, waste baskets, etc.) for exhibitor booths or displays. Outside food or drinks are not allowed in the facility. Sample size food and beverage items as a giveaway require approval by the ACCD Catering, our food and beverage management company. These items are subject to fee charges.

Utilities and technology/technical services are ordered by using the Online Ordering Portal. On-site utility service orders may be placed at the utility service desk and will be assessed at the Floor Rate plus labor charges.
