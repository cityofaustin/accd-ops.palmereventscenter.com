Any event that requires hazardous materials/medical wastes must receive written approval for their request thirty (30) days prior to the event. As part of this approval request, please include the following:

- A detailed list of all hazardous materials/medical wastes expected.
- A detailed plan of how materials will be handled, utilized, or the process of how they will be produced onsite.
- A detailed plan of how the materials will be removed and any associated cleanup performed.

Your Event Coordinator may assist you with facilitating these arrangements with the Security and Safety Division and the Austin Fire Department.

All potentially hazardous or medical waste should be removed from the facility at the end of the contracted event dates. Needles and sharps should be disposed of in RED puncture-resistant containers labeled with the biohazard symbol. All unregulated medical waste contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM) should be double bagged and removed from the Palmer Events Center.

Any hazardous or medical waste materials left at the facility after contracted event dates will be disposed of by the facility and billed to clients. Regulated waste must be disposed of in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations.
