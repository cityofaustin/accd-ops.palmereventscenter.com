Order paramedic services through your Security Coordinator thirty (30) days in advance. We may require additional medical services personnel for your event. A minimum of one (1) licensed paramedic is required to be onsite when:

- Event attendance is 5,000 or more, regardless of whether the event is private or open to the public
- Sporting or athletic events regardless of attendance
- Any event that your Event Coordinator considers necessary for the safety of your attendees
