The Palmer Events Center (PEC) is committed to ensuring that our venues are as convenient, accessible, and enjoyable as possible. While we make every effort to ensure accessibility of our facilities, should you require additional assistance, reasonable accommodations will be made for qualified persons with disabilities.

The PEC is responsible for the permanent building access requirements: such as, but not limited to, wheelchair ramps, elevator standards, restroom standards, and internal hallways and doors. The Client is responsible for the non-permanent accessibility requirements, such as, but not limited to, seating accessibility, assistive listening devices, sign language interpreters, signage, and other auxiliary aids.
