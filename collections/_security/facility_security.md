Procedures for handling emergency situations at Palmer Events Center have been established to minimize injuries and property damage. The Security Operations Center monitors all building emergency systems twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.

In the event of an emergency, the Security and Safety Division will activate a command post at a desired location. The command post simulates the Incident Command model for the management of significant emergency incidents. The Incident Commander (IC) is designed to oversee, manage, and make informed decisions in an emergency. The IC directs Palmer Events Center personnel and acts as a liaison between local law enforcement, fire service, emergency medical services, and civil defense.

A department Incident Commander (IC) is always available and identified based on immediate availability. An IC may initially be the highest-ranking security manager, supervisor, or lead on duty. The IC is subject to change during an emergency. The assigned Event Coordinator will keep clients apprised of the emergency and provide updates as the emergency is resolved.

### Emergency Procedures:

Palmer Events Center has evacuation and emergency plans. During your initial visit, or contact via email, your Security Coordinator will provide you with the facilities client Security and Safety Guide. The guide provides essential information regarding Facility Evacuation or Lockdown, Medical Emergency, Power Outage, Weather, and Hazardous Material response. Please take the time to familiarize yourself, your staff, volunteers, exhibitors, and contractors with the security and safety procedures. [Hyperlink to “client Security and Safety Guide”]
