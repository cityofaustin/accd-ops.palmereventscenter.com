The service yard is for service vehicles and scheduled event-related loading and unloading. Parking is not allowed in the service yard area, you may park at the 2nd or 5th street garage.

Event parking is not allowed in the Austin Convention Center circle drive located on Cesar Chavez Street.

Our garages possess mobility-impaired parking on every level. These spaces are located near the elevators. If your vehicle has a Disabled Veteran (DV) or other Meritorious Military Honors specialty plate, you receive complimentary parking.

Shuttle bus cutouts are located along Trinity Street from Cesar Chavez to 4th Street. Please notify your Event Coordinator or Sales Representative if you will have shuttle buses for your event and they will assist you with planning details. Vehicles and buses may not be left unattended in the cutouts as they are considered as a portion of a city street and are subject to ticketing by the Austin Police Department, City of Austin Parking Enforcement, or Austin Convention Center Security staff.
