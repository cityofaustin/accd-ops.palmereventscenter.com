Attendee parking is not allowed in the service yard area. The service yard is for service vehicles and scheduled event-related loading and unloading. The service yard is not a contracted space; we don’t guarantee the availability of parking in the service yard. Please note the circle drive is a contracted space. Clients are not allowed to sell or guarantee parking in the service yard for exhibitors or any general contractor. For service yard or circle drive usage, please contact your Event Coordinator.  

Our garages possess mobility-impaired parking on every level. These spaces are located near the elevators. If your vehicle has a Disabled Veteran (DV) or other Meritorious Military Honors specialty plate, you receive complimentary parking.

Please notify your Event Coordinator or Sales Representative if you will have shuttle buses for your event and they will assist you with planning details. Vehicles and buses may not be left unattended in the circle drives.                    
During events, an Event Security Staff member or Licensed Peace Officer may be required to control access to circle drives, service yard tunnel and all entry points to and from the building and parking garage, and driveways to maintain facility access. 

At Palmer Security’s discretion, the service yard may be split to accommodate multiple events.
