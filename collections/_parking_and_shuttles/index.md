If the Client is paying for attendee event parking, contact your Event Coordinator for options and information.

The service yard is for service vehicles and scheduled event-related or Austin Convention Center Department loading/unloading. Parking is not allowed in the service yard area. The service yard is not a contracted space; PEC does not guarantee the availability of parking in the service yard. Please note the circle drive is a contracted space. Clients are not allowed to sell or guarantee parking in the service yard for exhibitors or any general contractor. For service yard or circle drive usage, please contact your Event Coordinator.

Mobility Impaired Parking is available around the PEC and in the parking garages. These spaces are located near the elevators. If your vehicle has a Disabled Veteran (DV) or other Meritorious Military Honors specialty plate, you receive complimentary parking.

Please notify your Event Coordinator or Sales Representative if you will have shuttle buses for your event and they will assist you with planning details. Vehicles and buses may not be left unattended in the cutouts as they are considered as a portion of a city street and are subject to ticketing by the Austin Police Department, other City of Austin Parking Enforcement staff or ACCD Facility Security staff.

During events, an Event Security Staff member or LPO may be required to control access to circle drive, bus cutouts and driveways to maintain facility access.
