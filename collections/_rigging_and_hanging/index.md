title: Rigging and Hanging Points
order: 1
---

Submit requests for installation of show banners, exterior signs, interior signs, directional signs and rigging to your Event Coordinator thirty-one (31) days before the first contract day. A plan must be submitted indicating all points and the weight for each. An electronic version of facility space may be requested from your Event Coordinator or Sales Representative to assist you with the planning process.

All rigging services are supervised by a facility rigging specialist. Fees may apply. Bridling is not allowed; all rigging must be directly fixed to the structure or attached at a fixed elevation using chain, rods, or cable.

Palmer Events Center reserves the right to require the use of designated rigging personnel for hanging any item when necessary (including those under 100 lbs.) or when safety is a concern. Facility rigging personnel are required to approve any rigging for more than one hundred pounds (100 lbs.).

Items are not allowed to be attached to electrical or lighting conduits, utility pipes, or sprinkler systems.

All beam structures or other painted surfaces must be covered with protective material before wire, cable, or the like is attached to prevent damaging the painted surface.

Any material or equipment related to signs or rigging must be completely removed by the end of the last contract day.
