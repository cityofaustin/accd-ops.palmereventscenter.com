Other combustible materials must be flame resistant in accordance with NFPA 701 for textiles and films, and Underwriters Laboratories (U.L.) 1975 for foamed plastics.

Cotton batting, straw, dry vines, wood chips or leaves, celluloid or other flammable material are not allowed unless treated to an equivalent manner to NFPA 701. If applied by the exhibitor, proof of treatment must be provided to your Event Coordinator.
