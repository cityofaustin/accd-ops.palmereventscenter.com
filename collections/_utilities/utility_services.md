We provide all utilities as an exclusive service including, but not limited to, electrical, water and drain, gas, compressed air and telephone services. We ask that clients make utility service order forms available to exhibitors at least thirty (30) days before the first contract date. Clients are responsible for utility services costs assessed at the prevailing rate.
