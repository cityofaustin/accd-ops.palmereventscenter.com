Equipment is maintained to accommodate simultaneous events. Clients are responsible to obtain and provide labor to set up and dismantle equipment beyond the inventory of the Austin Convention Center. It is important to provide your Event Coordinator or Sales Representative with all the event information and equipment needs as soon as possible to ensure the facility has the necessary items for your event.
