Equipment is maintained to accommodate simultaneous events. Equipment beyond the inventory of Palmer Events Center is the client's responsibility to obtain and provide labor to set up and dismantle. It is important to provide your Event Coordinator or Sales Representative with all the event information and equipment needs as soon as possible to ensure the facility has the necessary items for your event.
