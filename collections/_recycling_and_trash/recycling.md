**Palmer Events Center exceeds the City of Austin’s recycling program.** Palmer Events Center recycles paper, cardboard, plastic bottles, glass bottles, aluminum and various metals. Material disposal should be handled as follows:

Corrugated cardboard – a separate baler is dedicated for corrugated cardboard only. Cardboard must be flattened by General Service Contractor personnel. If Palmer Events Center labor is used to flatten materials, clients will be assessed labor charges at the prevailing rate.

The General Service Contractor personnel must not place any material in the cardboard baler. Palmer Events Center designates staff will place items in the baler and operate it. Large bins will be provided to the General Service Contractor in order to discard all cardboard, recycle, and landfill materials. Palmer Events Center staff will discard the bins containing cardboard and recycle items and place them back in the exhibit halls. All landfill waste collected during move-in/move-out must be removed by the General Service Contractor and placed in their designated open top dumpsters. All other contents including, but not limited to: wooden materials, wooden pallets, cement block, padding, or hazardous materials should not be placed in the bins.
