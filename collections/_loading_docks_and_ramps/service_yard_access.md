title: Service Yard Access
order: 3
---

All move-in and move-out of exhibits must be through the service yard â€“ the designated loading dock, freight elevators and freight doors. The lobby areas, side doors, escalators and passenger elevators are not to be used for this purpose. 

The General Service Contractor is required to place at least one (1) representative at the entrance gate to the service yard to issue dock passes for freight waiting to enter the yard and unload at the dock.  This person should work in conjunction with the Austin Convention Center Facility Service Representative (FSR) at the main service yard gate. 

It is our policy that all contractors and their associated staff pick up a wristband at the service yard gate (located on Red River St.) before entering the building.

Parking is not allowed in the service yard area.
