Bulk trash is defined as boxes, crates, lumber, pallets, packing materials and any other excessive trash not easily removed by a standard push broom or vacuum.

Clients are responsible for removing all tape from the exhibit hall floor or carpeted areas at the end of the event.
Clean-up of excess trash will be charged to clients at the prevailing rate. Clients will also be responsible for costs associated with excessive event related clean-up.
