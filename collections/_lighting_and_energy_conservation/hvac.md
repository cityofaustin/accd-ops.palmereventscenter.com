Energy conservation is a high priority for us. Our facility maintains minimum levels of ventilation and lighting during move-in and move-out of contracted spaces. **Please keep in mind that air conditioning and heat is not provided during move-in and move-out of exhibit halls**.

- Set points during event days: seventy-two (72) degrees during the summer months and seventy (70) degrees during the winter months.
- A utility charge is assessed for special lighting and comfort level requirements during move-in, show, and move-out.
